1. How can you implement shared functionality across a component tree?

There are several ways to implement shared functionality across a component tree in React:

a) Context API: Use React's Context API to provide shared data or functions to multiple components without explicitly passing props through each level.

b) Custom Hooks: Create custom hooks that encapsulate reusable logic and can be used across multiple components.

c) Higher-Order Components (HOCs): Use HOCs to wrap components and provide additional functionality or props.

d) Render Props: Use the render props pattern to share code between components using a prop whose value is a function.

e) Composition: Compose components together, passing down shared functionality as props.

2. Why is the useState hook appropriate for handling state in a complex component?

The useState hook is appropriate for handling state in complex components for several reasons:

a) Simplicity: It provides a straightforward way to add state to functional components.

b) Modularity: You can use multiple useState hooks to manage different pieces of state separately, making the code more organized.

c) Flexibility: It can handle both simple and complex state structures.

d) Performance: React optimizes state updates to minimize unnecessary re-renders.

e) Testability: It's easier to test components that use useState compared to class components with complex state management.

f) Compatibility: It works well with other hooks like useEffect, useContext, etc., allowing for more advanced state management patterns.
